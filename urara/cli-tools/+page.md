It is a useful tool for those who need to quickly access a gpt through the terminal.

CLI or Command-Line Interface tools are an essential part of software development and system administration. They provide an efficient way for users to interact with an operating system or a software application by executing commands in the terminal rather than using a graphical user interface. CLI tools offer several advantages, such as the ability to automate repetitive tasks, save time performing complex operations, and provide greater control over the system.
